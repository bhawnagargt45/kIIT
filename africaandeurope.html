                <b>Africa's economy</b>
             <ul>
                 <li> According to one estimate, by 2050 the combined economy of Africa will be worth some $29 trillion  ten time as much as today. Data from the Pew Research Center offers a clue as to why: it says the continents population will rise from 1.3 billion to 2.5 billion in 2050, and on to 4.3 billion in 2100, with those gains mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, which is expected to triple in population.</li>
             </ul>
               <b>Africa population</b>
             <ul>
                 <li>The populations of more than half of Africas 54 nations will double  or more  by 2050, the product of sustained high fertility and improving mortality rates. The continent will then be home to at least 25% of the worlds population, compared with less than 10% in 1950.</li>

                In the year 2050, technology will dominate the workplace with artificial intelligence and smart assistants being commonplace, while the use of augmented and virtual reality continues to increase. Everything will be smart connected and data-driven. The vast majority of us will continue working the same way we are today, but the jobs on offer will be ones that havent yet been invented. Emotional intelligence and human skills such as perpetual learning will be crucial for leaders to possess, as well as fluency with the latest technologies.
                <br>
                Work will increasingly become more fluid as some employees will be virtual, some will be full-time, some will be bots, and we will all be working non-fixed hours. As with any kind of change, there will be pros and cons. Those who work in routine jobs are likely to struggle to make sure they can stay relevant in the new world of work. The advantage is that this will give us more time to focus on the human aspects of work such as building relationships, being creative, deep thinking, and practicing skills like empathy and self-awareness. Technology will help us make organizations more personable. This also means that we need to get more comfortable with using technology such as bots and AI in our work, a cause of tension and fear for some.

                And what about working hours? It depends if youre a knowledge worker or working in industries like retail. Flexible work arrangements are already being implemented at organizations around the world. The advantages are far-ranging, from improving employee satisfaction, productivity and tenure, to being able to attract and retain top talent. The potential disadvantages here are making sure that employees can stay accountable for delivering high-quality work while feeling like theyre a part of the team, dealing with isolation, and ensuring effective communication and collaboration. I think the pros outstrip the cons: when managed effectively, flexible work arrangements can be a huge benefit to the organization and its people.
